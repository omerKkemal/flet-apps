PhantomGet - A backdoor framework for remote control and management of compromised systems.
This code is part of the PhantomGet project, which is designed to provide a backdoor functionality
for remote access and control over compromised machines. It includes features for command execution,
data retrieval, and system management through a web interface.
This file contains the Setting class, which is responsible for managing application settings,
including paths for logs and database, instruction types, statuses, and network-related configurations.
It also provides utility methods for generating random identifiers.

        Initializes the settings for the application, including paths for
        logs and database, as well as instruction types and statuses.
        This method sets up the necessary configuration for the application
        to function correctly.
        It defines the following attributes:
            - LOG_DIR: Directory path for logs
            - LOG_FILE_NAME: Name of the log file
            - LOG_FILE_PATH: Full path to the log file
            - DB_NAME: Name of the database file
            - DB_DIR: Directory where the database is stored
            - DB_URI: URI for the database connection
            - INSTRUCTION: List of instruction types
            - STUTAS: List of statuses for the application
            - BUIT_IN_COMMAND: List of built-in commands
            - API_TOKEN: Token for API authentication
        It also initializes various network-related settings such as:
            - PORT: List of common ports used for various protocols
            - FAKE_HEADERS: List of fake headers for network requests
            - BASE_DELAY: Base delay for network operations
            - MAX_DELAY: Maximum delay for network operations
            - MIN_DELAY: Minimum delay for network operations
            - ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD: Threshold for adapting delay based on request count
        The method does not return any value but sets up the instance variables
        that can be accessed throughout the application. It is typically called
        during the initialization of the application to ensure that all settings
        are configured before any operations are performed.
        This method does not take any parameters and does not return any value.
